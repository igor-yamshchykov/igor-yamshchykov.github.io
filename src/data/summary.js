      &nbsp;&nbsp; I have over 6 years of total experience working with web
      development. I am familiar with many popular programming languages,
      frameworks, and methodologies, however, most I am most efficient with
      Python and javascript.

      &nbsp;&nbsp; During my career, I was developing different web
      applications, websites, and web services.

    <div>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; Backend or integration work is preferable, but I can also
      work with frontend parts. I've gone through all of the software
      development life cycle processes and I am able to set up initial project
      architecture, develop, test, and release the application.
    </div>
    <div>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; I will be most efficient in web or web-related development
      but after some time (depending on the project complexity) I can dive into
      any type of software development.
